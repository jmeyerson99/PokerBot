A Texas Hold Em Odds Calculator and Poker Playing Program

## Current Status

The current software runs unit tests to correctly identify the strength of hands. There is also a test simulator that will simulate 1 hand and organize the rankings at showdown. Hand equity percentages are currently working, except for preflop. Postflop, percentages are accurate. Soon, unit testing will follow for percentages.
